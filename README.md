The project is called FAKE PRODUCT DETECTOR which is aimed 
to help the Government to counterract the issue of fake products that
are being entered in the market.

the Project is inspired from a large number of Consumers
who die from the Counterfeit goods especially those whose expire dates have reached
and the authority that is used to monitor this is strictly TBS.

### How the system works

the system will use the android application that will be able to use
smartphone camera of the user to scan the QR code on the project
that was designed for only the application to be able to detect the QR code
this QR CODE will give Product description like 
- Product price
- Product manufactured date and time
- Product expiry date
- Product manufacturer and details etc

The system will be able to submit the signal to the authorities (Police)
giving them the location of the counterfeit goods

###Advantages

- The system will help the authorities to get the information on the people who counterfeit the goods
- The system will easen the issue of price asking and description to shop owners

###Disadvantages 
-The system may not reach small scale entreprenuers
